make a .env file
here is an example of how it should look like
uname=<your campnet username>
pwd=<password>

make sure you dont have ' ' character anywhere, or quotes.

first run the campnet_autologin.py python file to see whats missing to install them.
then run the setup_autologin.bat by "./setup_autologin.bat"
it will now keep you logged into bits wifi everytime!

the plus point here is, this works even when you restart windows!!

but if you want it to STOP working, run "./setup_autologin.bat --remove"

someone pls make it work on android! :)
